# BENCHMARKS-An-Analysis-of-Massachusetts-Court-Reversals
CS 506 - Final Project (Team Members - Yashvardhan, Abhimanyu, Yuwan, Anton)
We are working with BENCHMARKS: A Citizenâ€™s Scorecard on Judicial Accountability in Massachusetts
to determine the conditions under which judicial rulings are more or less likely to be reversed.
Ideally, the project will uncover never before-seen patterns of judicial behavior and decision-making in criminal and civil cases,
which will have the effect of recasting and spurring more aggressive local news coverage of the state court system.
As a result, the project should become a valuable tool for judicial accountability. 
This project is mentored by Maggie Mulvihill from the College of Communication Journalism Department and is partnered with the Boston Globe. 
Benchmarks seeks to combine data analysis and investigative journalism to create results that are more impactful than just using one of the two.
Specifically, this project should serve as a building block for a new Boston University interdisciplinary news team which will examine case reversals in all 50 states over the past decade.
