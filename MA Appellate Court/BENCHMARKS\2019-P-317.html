					<td valign=top>Copy of Memorandum and Order entered on 19-J-65: This is a summary process action in which the plaintiff seeks to evict the defendants -- who are mother and daughter -- post-foreclosure. After a judge of the Housing Court entered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants filed a timely appeal. The plaintiff moved to set the amount of the appeal bond, and before the amount of that bond was set, the defendants moved to waive the bond requirement based on indigency. See G. L. c. 239, &#167;&#167; 5, 6. A Housing Court refused to entertain the motion to waive because she deemed it untimely (presumably because it was not filed within ten days of the underlying judgment). Before me now, as single justice, is the defendants' appeal of the setting of the bond. For the reasons that follow, deciding this question turns on the resolution of three issues, all of which raise important questions affecting the administration of justice. Because these issues appropriately should be resolved by a panel of this court (or the Supreme Judicial Court), I am referring this matter for plenary review pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 and Appeals Court Rule 2:01. I am also ordering that this appeal be expedited.<br><br>Timeliness. Although the relevant statutory text is not as clear as the plaintiff claims, it appears correct that those seeking to have an appeal bond waived are required to file such a motion within ten days of the underlying judgment. G. L. c. 239, &#167; 5. I therefore agree with the Housing Court judge that the defendants' motion to waive the appeal bond was untimely. However, the key question is not whether the motion was timely, but instead what legal consequences flow from its untimeliness. The judge appears to have assumed that this deprived her of jurisdiction to consider a waiver of the appeal bond, no matter how indigent the defendants may be, and no matter how meritorious their appellate issues may be. To my mind, this is far from clear.<br><br>To be sure, when the Legislature has set a deadline for the filing of an appeal, that deadline generally is considered jurisdictional. See Friedman v. Bd. of Registration in Medicine, 414 Mass. 663, 665 (1993). However, the defendants here filed a timely appeal notwithstanding that they had only ten days to do so. Their tardiness went only to a subsidiary matter, a motion to waive the posting of an appeal bond that had not yet been set. Absent explicit language regarding the jurisdictional consequences of such tardiness, I find it difficult to believe that the Legislature intended to deprive an indigent party being evicted from being able to prosecute a potentially meritorious argument on appeal, where she both filed a timely appeal and requested that the appeal bond be waived before it ever was set.[2] Cf. United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 135 S. Ct. 1625, 1631-1632 (2015) (enactment of statute of limitations does not bar judicial consideration of equitable tolling absent clear statement by Congress).[3]<br><br>Because the judge ruled that the defendants were too late to request a waiver of the appeal bond, she did not entertain whether they had raised a "not frivolous" appellate issue and whether they had documented their indigency. G. L. c. 239, &#167; 5. I turn to those issues.<br><br>Merits. As the judge observed in her ruling on plaintiff's (renewed) motion for summary judgment, the defendants' based their only substantive argument "on the fact that the Plaintiff has not produced the original Note on the loan." The judge rejected that argument as a matter of law, concluding that "there is no requirement that the original Note be produced. See Bek v. Wells Fargo Home Mtg, 2018 U.S. Dist. Lexis 152896 (D. Mass. Sept. 7, 2018)." This appellate issue quite arguably qualifies as nonfrivolous. See Eaton v. Federal National Mortgage Association, 462 Mass. 569, 586 n. 26 (declining to reach the argument that a note is a negotiable instrument subject to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)).[4] Bek, the case relied upon by the judge, is not to the contrary. The magistrate judge there rejected the homeowner's UCC argument not on the merits, but because he had not sufficiently developed the issue. Moreover, Bek is of no binding precedential effect on State courts.<br><br>Indigency. One of the defendants (Kelly Johnson, the daughter) submitted an affidavit that documents her indigency. The other defendant (Patricia O'Dell, the mother) did not submit one of her own. Prior to, and at, the hearing before me, the plaintiff asserted its view that O'Dell is gainfully employed and would not likely be able to document her indigency. The plaintiff argued that all defendants in a summary process action should have to demonstrate their indigency for an appeal bond to be waived. For their part, the defendants maintained that one affidavit of indigency was sufficient. They also argued that regardless of whether O'Dell was "indigent," she was counting on the house for her retirement and would have trouble paying the amount of the appeal bond.<br><br>To my mind, the legal arguments made by both sides miss the mark. I disagree with the plaintiff's position that all defendants in a summary process case must demonstrate their indigency, and with the defendants' position that one affidavit of indigency necessarily is sufficient. To my mind, the relevant question is whether a defendant with standing to raise the appellate issue that merits waiver of the bond has demonstrated her indigency. If so, that person could request waiver of the bond, regardless of whether others could do so. If not, then waiver of the bond would appear unjustified.<br><br>As I recognized in a post-hearing procedural order, the limited record before me suggested that Johnson, despite her close familial relationship to O'Dell, may have had no ownership interest in the property beyond some form of informal leasehold. If Johnson were not in a position to assert the absence of the original note (to which she apparently is not a party) as a defense to the foreclosure, then I did not see how her indigency could provide grounds for waiving the appeal bond. I invited the defendants to file a supplemental submittal to document one or both of the following: 1) Johnson's legal relationship to the property and what, if anything, provides her standing to raise the question of the missing original note, and 2) an affidavit of indigency for O'Dell.[5]<br><br>In their supplemental submittal, the defendants made no claim that O'Dell was indigent. Instead, they rested their claim for a waiver of the appeal bond on Johnson's indigency. Without claiming that Johnson had any ownership interest in the property prior to the foreclosure or was a party to the note or mortgage, they made various arguments that she nevertheless had standing to raise the issue of the lost note. For example, the defendants argued that Johnson's expectation of inheriting the property was sufficient. I personally find such arguments unconvincing. However, there are no reported cases that address the indigency showing that appellants are required to make in the context of a summary process action targeting multiple occupants.<br><br>Disposition. In my view, this case raises three extremely important legal issues that should be resolved through plenary review, not by a single justice of this court. Therefore, I am referring this case to a panel of this court. The entry fee is waived and the appeal is entered this date as docket number 2019-P-317. The appellate record shall consist of the record already assembled by the Housing Court and currently filed as 19-J-65, supplemented by the submittals made to me on that docket. The defendants shall file their brief(s) and appendix on or before April 1, 2019, and the plaintiff's brief shall be filed on or before May 1, 2019.[6] No party shall seek an enlargement of time to file a brief, except for extraordinary circumstances. The appeal shall be scheduled for argument in June 2019. (Milkey, J.). *Notice/Attest/Horan, J.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>1. Patricia O'Dell.<br><br>2. Where a motion to file an appeal bond is late, it may make sense to hold the appellant to a higher standard than raising a "not frivolous" issue. Compare Mass. R. App. P. 14(b) (allowing an extension of time "for good cause shown"). In the case before me, the defendants plainly have raised an issue warranting appeal.<br><br>3. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated with respect to Federal statutes, "in applying that clear statement rule, we have made plain that most time bars are nonjurisdictional . . . Time and again, we have described filing deadlines as 'quintessential claim-processing rules,' which 'seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation,' but do not deprive a court of authority to hear a case." Id. 1632 (internal citations omitted).<br><br>4. I recognize that other passages in Eaton can be taken to suggest that it is sufficient for the foreclosing entity to submit an affidavit that asserts on its face that the entity either holds the note or is authorized to act on behalf of the party that does (while skirting the issue of whether the original note can be found and, if not, whether the appropriate UCC process that applies when a negotiable instrument has been lost has been followed). See Id. at 589 n. 28.<br><br>5. With regard to the latter, I specifically called the parties' attention to section c of the form affidavit which provides a litigant the opportunity to try to demonstrate indigency on a case by case basis (as opposed to a showing based on the status of the litigant as a recipient of government benefits or on income).<br><br>6. To the extent the defendants remain self-represented, they may continue to submit unitary filings provided they each sign the filing.

					<td valign=top>ANNOUNCEMENT: The Appeals Court encourages interested parties to file amicus curiae ("friend of the court") briefs in U.S. Bank Trust N.A., as Trustee v. Kelly Johnson & another, 19-P-317. Any party not directly involved in this case, but that has an interest or opinion about this case pending before the court may file an amicus brief in accordance with Rule 17. All amicus submissions shall comply with Rules 17 and 20 of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure. The issues before the Court in this case are:<br><br>1. Where a defendant in a summary process action in the Housing Court filed a timely appeal of an adverse judgment of possession and requested that the posting of an appeal bond be waived prior to the amount of the bond being set, does her failure to file such a motion within ten days of the judgment deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain the motion?<br><br>2. Where a defendant in a post-foreclosure summary process action has raised as a defense, the failure of the foreclosing entity to demonstrate that it (or the party on whose behalf the entity is authorized to act) holds the original note, has the defendant demonstrated a "not frivolous" appellate issue warranting the waiver of the requirement to post an appeal bond if the defendant is indigent? See G. L. c. 239, &#167; 5; Eaton v. Federal National Mortgage Association, 462 Mass. 569, 586 n.26, 589 n.28 (2012). See also Mitchell vs. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, Appeals Court, No. 17-P-1445, slip op. at 3 (Mar. 4, 2019).<br><br>3. Where there are multiple defendants in a post-foreclosure summary process action, but the motion to waive the posting of an appeal bond is based on the indigency of only one of them, must that defendant demonstrate her own standing to raise a "not frivolous" argument on appeal and, if so, what showing is sufficient? *Notice.

Accordingly, we conclude that, though Johnson has standing to move for a waiver of any requirement that she post an appeal bond, Johnson's indigency does not excuse O'Dell from the requirement to post a bond (if O'Dell is not indigent).' In all other respects the opinion remains the same. The Reporter of Decisions has been notified, and a copy of the revised opinion will be issued to the parties on this date. The rescript shall issue twenty-eight days from the date of this order. (Green, C.J., Maldonado, & Hand, JJ.). *Notice
