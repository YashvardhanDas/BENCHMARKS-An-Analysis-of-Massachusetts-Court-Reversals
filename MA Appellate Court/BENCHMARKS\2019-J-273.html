					<td valign=top>ORDER:This an appeal from an order of the Housing Court denying the defendant's motion to waive the appeal bond and order for periodic payments. This is a summary process action brought by an arm's length purchaser for value after a foreclosure sale rather than a mortgagee. The pro se defendant argued in the trial court that the third party purchaser was not the owner of the property because the entity that sold the property was not the lawful holder of the mortgage with the power of sale. The motion judge allowed the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, saying "Here the Defendant's arguments, all of them, are directed at an entity that is not a party to this action, i.e. the foreclosing institution. Furthermore, he can not put forth claims as to the Plaintiff without more than bare assertions. Finally, the Defendant has not exercised his rights under G.L.c. 244 sec. 15. As such the Plaintiff is entitled to the protections contained therein as a bona fide third party purchaser." The defendant filed a notice of appeal and moved to waive the appeal bond. The judge denied that motion, holding that, while the defendant was indigent, he lacked a non-frivolous defense. She held, "The Defendant's arguments were considered at the hearing for summary judgment and again at this hearing and they are without merit as to this Plaintiff, a third-party purchaser." The judge ordered the defendant to pay a bond of $6,400 and periodic monthly payments of $800.<br><br>There is no dispute about the defendant's indigency. Rather, I must determine whether there is any non-frivolous basis for the appeal. Home Savings Bank of America, FSB v. Camillo, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (1998). This has been held to mean that I must determine whether there is an issue worthy of presentation to an appellate panel. Commonwealth v. Levin, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 504 (1979). As the defendant points out the question is not whether he has a winning argument; he is entitled to have the appeal bond waived even if he has only "a prayer of a chance." Camillo, supra at 911, quoting Pires v. Commonwealth, 373 Mass. 829, 838 (1977).<br><br>The plaintiff asserts, and the judge held, that because it is a third party bona fide purchaser the defenses the defendant raises are not available in a summary process action. In particular, the plaintiff raises the protections afforded by G. L. c. 244, &#167; 15. However, in point of fact, under the statutory language, the protections of that statute for bona fide purchasers only come into play in certain circumstances "after three years from the date" of the recording of an affidavit by the seller. That period has not yet passed. Indeed, G. L. c. 244, &#167; 15 (d), at least, contemplates the possibility that "a party entitled to notice of sale under . . . &#167; 14 who continues to occupy the mortgage premises as that party's principal place of residence" might be able to "challenge . . . the validity of the foreclosure sale . . . as a defense . . . in a legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction."<br><br>The plaintiff also argues, and the judge held, that, even in the absence of the statute, the defendant cannot raise defenses to the validity of the mortgagee's actions in a summary process action brought by a bona fide purchaser. This appears to be an open question, and it is an important one.<br><br>But even if the judge was in error on that point, after close examination of the judge's opinion, I conclude that would be insufficient standing alone to get the defendant over the frivolousness bar. This is because the judge also held that, on the merits, the defendant's claims were based on nothing more than "bare assertions." If the defendant's claims on the merits are frivolous because they are unsupported, even if he can raise them in defense to this action, his appeal has no chance of success.<br><br>With this in mind, I have examined the defendant's defenses and examined those portions of the record before me. I also take judicial notice of the assignments of the mortgage that are recorded in the Registry of Deeds, which are not in the appellate record, but which I have examined. The defendant apparently argued at summary judgment that there is no clear chain of title regarding the mortgage, that he was not properly served with a Notice to Quit, that his mortgage was unenforceable, that the foreclosing entity violated G. L. c. 93A by foreclosing notwithstanding that it knew or should have known that the mortgage was unenforceable, and that the foreclosing entity unlawfully refused his demand to view the note. As the judge indicated, there is no evidence in the record supporting those claims that are legally sound. In particular, there is nothing indicating the actual value of the property at the time of the mortgage -- essential to the defendant's claim that the mortgage was unenforceable -- nor do I perceive anything improper with respect to the chain of title.<br><br>The defendant raised some additional arguments in a motion for reconsideration, which the judge denied without a hearing "as Defendant has offered no argument that could not have been put forth at original hearing or any evidence to support such." These arguments were that the foreclosing entity lacked the statutory authority to own or convey the mortgage, that "Plaintiff's predecessor" did not comply with 209 Code Mass. Regs. 18.21A (2), that the mortgage affidavit was signed by a person who lacked personal knowledge of the matters to which he swore, and that the plaintiff lacked standing because it did not own the property. (He has also raised a claim that the assignments are out of order, but they are in order, and the fact that they were recorded out of order is of no legal relevance.) Because these claims were not raised until the motion for reconsideration, and not reviewed on the merits by the judge who denied that motion, all but the standing argument, which can never be waived, are waived and cannot successfully be raised on appeal. And the standing argument merely stated without elaboration that the plaintiff did not own the property, a bare assertion not worthy of appellate review.<br><br>As a consequence, I conclude that the defendant's appeal presents no question worthy of appellate review. The order denying the defendant's motion to waive the appeal bond and periodic payments is therefore affirmed. (Rubin, J) Notice/Attest/Horan, J.
