					<td valign=top>Memorandum of Decision and Judgment: " After a jury in the Roxbury Division of the Boston Municipal Court convicted the defendant, Wandy Valenzuela Cruz, of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, &#167; 15A, the trial judge allowed Cruz's motion for a mistrial. The Commonwealth has filed a petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, seeking to vacate the judge's order allowing the motion and to have the jury's verdict reinstated. For the reasons set forth below, the petition is denied. The charge against Cruz stemmed from an incident between Cruz and her husband, the victim. Cruz struck the victim on the head with the metal handle of a broom and threw his cellular telephone at him after discovering messages on the telephone from another woman. At trial, she claimed self-defense and testified on her own behalf. Her counsel, in closing argument, stated that Cruz's testimony that the victim was the first aggressor and that she struck the victim in self-defense was consistent with what she had told the police officers at the scene of the incident (i.e., prior to her arrest). The prosecutor, in turn, in her closing argument, stated that prior to trial, Cruz had not claimed self-defense or told the police that the victim was the first aggressor. At the conclusion of the prosecutor's argument, Cruz moved for a mistrial on the basis that the prosecutor, in noting that Cruz had not claimed self-defense prior to trial, had impermissibly commented on Cruz's pre-arrest silence. The judge reserved ruling on the motion until after the jury returned their verdict. After the jury found Cruz guilty, and after briefing by both parties, the judge allowed the motion for a mistrial. In its petition, the Commonwealth argues that review pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, is appropriate because the judge's erroneous decision constitutes a substantial violation of a substantive right for which the Commonwealth has no other remedy. The Commonwealth is correct that where, as here, a judge takes a motion for mistrial under advisement until after the jury verdict, "the Commonwealth has no right to appeal from the judge's order granting the defendant's motion for a mistrial." <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Brangan</u>, 475 Mass. 143, 148 (2016). It does not necessarily follow, however, that the Commonwealth is entitled to seek review pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3. Even if G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, "provides the only avenue for seeking review of the judge's decision . . . the fact that the Commonwealth has no other remedy does not make G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, review automatic." <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Richardson</u>, 454 Mass. 1005, 1005 (2009), quoting <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Cook</u>, 380 Mass. 314, 319 (1980). See <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Snow</u>, 456 Mass. 1019, 1019 (2010) (that G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, provides only means by which Commonwealth can seek review of judge's decision "is not dispositive of the question whether the use of [the statute is] appropriate in these circumstances"). The fact that we noted in the <u>Brangan</u> case that "[i]f a judge's mistrial determination constitutes particularly egregious error, such a decision remains reviewable by this court," pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Brangan</u>, 475 Mass. at 148 n. 10, does not mean that every mistrial determination is necessarily reviewable in this fashion. The judge's ruling in this case was not such a decision, and I therefore decline, as a matter of discretion, to employ the court's superintendence power to review it on the merits. "A single justice, in his or her discretion, may . . . properly decline to employ the court's extraordinary power of general superintendence where exceptional circumstances are not present." <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Narea</u>, 454 Mass. 1003, 1004 n. 1 (2009). In the Commonwealth's view, the judge's determination that the prosecutor's closing argument impermissibly commented on Cruz's silence (i.e., her pre-arrest "silence" as to self-defense) was incorrect. Rather, and again according to the Commonwealth, the prosecutor was permissibly questioning Cruz's credibility, by contrasting her statements to the police at the time of the incident with her testimony at trial. Even if the judge erred -- a point on which I express no view -- I disagree with the Commonwealth that the ruling constitutes "particularly egregious error" warranting the exercise of this court's extraordinary power pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3. The Commonwealth, so far as I can tell, is free to retry Cruz and, in that regard, has not been deprived of any substantive right. Furthermore, as to the Commonwealth's argument that the judge's error in this case is not an isolated occurrence, the details that the Commonwealth provides on this point are scant. The Commonwealth states that it anticipates imminently filing a petition in another case challenging a "similarly egregious post-verdict grant of a mistrial," but it provides no details, such as whether the cases involve the same issue (i.e., the trial judge's purported misunderstanding of the law relevant to a defendant's pre-arrest silence), or any other argument of a systemic problem; and, so far as I am aware, no such petition has yet been filed. Additionally, of note, prior to closing arguments while the judge was discussing with counsel the charges that she would provide to the jury, defense counsel expressed his concern that the prosecutor might comment, in her closing argument, that Cruz "did not say more." In response the judge stated, "I want to make this very clear. The defendant may have said statements to the police; however she was not required to say anything to the police. So when you tread in that area, I don't want to give an instruction and I might not be able to cure anything that is said, and I am going to instruct them that it is not evidence, but it is important that we keep into our view that there is a fifth amendment and the defendant is not required to say anything to anyone." The judge thereby warned the Commonwealth not to comment on Cruz's pre-arrest silence on the issue of self-defense and the Commonwealth nonetheless commented on it anyway. Regardless, again, whether the judge made an erroneous ruling, the fact that the judge allowed Cruz's motion for a mistrial after the Commonwealth disregarded her admonition lends to my conclusion that the judge's mistrial ruling in this case is not the type of exceptional circumstance that warrants employing our general superintendence power. For these reasons, I decline to exercise my discretion to issue the relief requested. It is hereby ORDERED that the Commonwealth's petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, &#167; 3, is DENIED without hearing." (Budd, J.) [1] [1] The Commonwealth also argues that this court's decision in <u>Commonwealth</u> v. <u>Brangan</u>, 475 Mass. 143 (2016), concluding that the Commonwealth has no right to appeal from a judge's post-verdict allowance of a motion for a mistrial made prior to the verdict, was wrong. As a single justice I am not inclined to ignore or overrule a decision of the full court; nor am I inclined to report this case to the full court for consideration of that issue.
